This folder contains the first full version of the single point kpp model.
1) For starting one can execute "run_kpp.sh", where you can specify the desired 
latitude and longitude, which then extract initial condition netcdf data and
generates noise forcing for 500 years (6 hourly time step)

2) You can change "timestep.nml" file to control the number of iterations
for flux correction.

3) Set surface temperature/salinity restoring. changes are in ocn.f
temp restoring = 10W/m2/K

4) Look at "generate_6hrly_forcing.f" to make changes to noise force production

5) If you are repeating the simulation with the same location and forces, please 
use "run.sh" script to re-run the model

6) Check byjas_1D_ocn.f (which is the main program) to see the flux-correction 
subroutines. By default, it uses both seasonal and long-drift-trend correction.

7) This code saves data monthly only, 6 hourly output is converted to monthly so
that it reduces the time taken for simulation, also the size of the folder.
